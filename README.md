## Jake Pilikian

A patient, self-motivated, honest and passionate person. I am often known by my friends and coworkers as an innovative, creative and knowledgable person with acute attention to detail. I love photography, music, film, physics, philosophy, tech, and most of all, video games. Some of my hobbies include building computers, writing short stories and making video games. I am also active and enjoy basketball, tennis and hiking. 

As a recent graduate from Makers, I have learnt a number of different tech stacks including Ruby and JavaScript, working in agile teams with a focus on TDD, and ultimately, the ability to learn anything.

What excites me most about tech is that anything is possible. I love tuning into events like the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) to see how comapnies have innovated and developed tech, particularly in TVs, PCs, video cameras, virtual reality and sound systems.
