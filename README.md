## Jake Pilikian

A patient, self-motivated, honest and passionate software developer. I am often known by my friends and coworkers as an innovative, creative and knowledgable person with acute attention to detail. 

As a recent graduate from Makers, I have learnt several different tech stacks including Ruby and JavaScript, working in agile teams with a focus on TDD, and ultimately, the ability to learn anything.

I'm passionate about tech and spent over 4 years working at Apple. What excites me most about tech is that anything is possible. I love tuning into events like the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) to see how companies have innovated and developed tech, particularly in TVs, PCs, video cameras, virtual reality and sound systems.

## Skills

#### Teamwork & Communication

Throughout my career in Apple and my experience at Makers, one of my best skills has been my ability to communicate effectively and honestly with my peers. I have further honed my communication skills at Makers through pair programming and working in Agile teams daily by leading stand-ups, retros and holding feedback sessions with my peers.

#### Innovation, Creativity & Learning

As someone who loves video games, I knew I wanted to make a mobile game for my final project. It also had to feature dragons and pirates which are two of my favourite themes in a game. I immediately began to look at the games I play regularly on my phone. I thought about what I loved about them and what made them fun to play and began to draft my user stories. I also discovered that most of them were built using the Unity engine and programmed using C# scripts. In just two weeks, I was able to learn an entirely new tech stack and build my first video game. It is with great pleasure that I can now announce that my two-week final project [Dragons of the Caribbean](https://github.com/carlfjones/DragonPirates) will be coming soon to a mobile app store near you!

## Experience

**Apple** (March 2014 to June 2018)    
*Specialist*  
- Occasionally supported Apple's [Swift Playgrounds Workshops](https://www.apple.com/uk/swift/playgrounds/)

**Vend** (July 2018 to December 2018)

*Public Speaking & Events Organisation*
- Starting a new career as a software developer is both exciting and challenging. When I'm not working on projects in my spare time, I support the events team at Makers. This includes helping the team to stay organised by sticking to a schedule and making guests feel welcome. I also take part in a monthly Q&A panel where potential students may ask me questions about my journey as a software developer with Makers. This allows me to network with people while continuing to develop my public speaking skills.

## Hobbies

I love photography, music, film, literature, physics, philosophy, tech, and most of all, story-driven video games. Some of my favourite projects include building computers, writing short stories and making video games. I am also active and enjoy basketball, tennis and hiking. 

I also love competitive gaming! Although adopting the growth mindset has been great for coding, it's also really helped me when competing in esports. Learning through defeat is one of the most powerful techniques one can use to improve.
