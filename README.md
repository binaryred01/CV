## Jake Pilikian

A patient, self-motivated, honest and passionate person. I am often known by my friends and coworkers as an innovative, creative and knowledgable person with acute attention to detail. I love photography, music, film, physics, philosophy, tech, and most of all, video games. Some of my hobbies include building computers, writing short stories and making video games. I am also active and enjoy basketball, tennis and hiking. 

As a recent graduate from Makers, I have learnt a number of different tech stacks including Ruby and JavaScript, working in agile teams with a focus on TDD, and ultimately, the ability to learn anything.

What excites me most about tech is that anything is possible. I love tuning into events like the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) to see how comapnies have innovated and developed tech, particularly in TVs, PCs, video cameras, virtual reality and sound systems.

## Skills

#### Teamwork & Communication

Throughout my career in Apple and my experience at Makers, one of my best skills has been my ability to communicate effectively and honestly with my peers. I have further honed my communication skills at Makers through pair programming and working in agile teams on a daily basis by leading stand ups, retros and holding feedback sessions with my peers.

## Hobbies

I love competitive gaming! Although adopting the growth mindset has been great for coding, it's also really helped me when competing in esports. Learning through defeat is one of the most powerful techniques one can use in order to improve.
